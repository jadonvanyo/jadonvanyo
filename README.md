### Hello there! I'm Jay Vanyo!

I've been captivated by programming ever since discovering its power in my Engineering Analysis courses in college. Our professor allowed us to use our MatLab scripts from homework exercises during quizzes and tests. I would these craft elaborate scripts that could handle various scenarios. On test day I simply input the test problem values, run the script, and copy down the solutions. These early scripts sparked my love for programming's unique problem-solving capabilities.

After college, I studied Computer Science in my spare time, completing Harvard's CS50x course. The recent advancements in artificial intelligence motivated me to create a Flask-based web application for my final project that would assist users in tailoring their resumes to job descriptions, [Resi.ai](https://github.com/jadonvanyo/resi.ai). Through this project, I discovered my passion for Python's beautiful simplicity and efficiency.

**I am actively seeking opportunities in backend web development, with a particular interest in Python development.** If you're looking for a dedicated and passionate developer, I would be thrilled to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team!
